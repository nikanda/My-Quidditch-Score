# My-Quidditch-Score.-
Udacity. Google Developer Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics. Lesson 9: Project: Court Counter App
Hi, I'm Veronica. A student on the Android Basics course.
I make an independent project My Quidditch Score.
In this version there are several bugs.
1. Fault buttons remain active when team selection dialog (popup) is visible.
2. List items in fault list are not erased when user presses the "Resets game" button
